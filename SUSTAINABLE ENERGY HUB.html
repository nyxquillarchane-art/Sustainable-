                            <li><strong>Switch to LEDs:</strong> Replace any remaining incandescent or CFL bulbs with LEDs. They use up to 80% less energy.</li>
                            <li><strong>Seal Your Home:</strong> Check for drafts around windows and doors. Proper insulation and sealing can save 10-20% on heating and cooling costs.</li>
                            <li><strong>Smart Thermostats:</strong> Install a programmable or smart thermostat to optimize your heating and cooling schedules automatically.</li>

                            <li><strong>Green Energy Tariffs:</strong> Check with your utility provider. Most offer a plan that allows you to pay a small premium to source your electricity from 100% renewable sources.</li>
